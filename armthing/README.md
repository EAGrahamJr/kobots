# The Arm Thing

First "robot" experiment. The intent is to create a robotic arm that can fetch things and move them about.

Overall, this has been somewhat successful in that the goal was generally achieved. There were several hardware iterations involved, which are somewhat documented in my [Photos Kobots Album]
(https://photos.app.goo.gl/kWWJ8uUjWdHnsVDY6).

# Lessons Learned

- Gear ratios are a pain, but they will save your butt
- Torque is seriously real
  - Many iterations not covered here managed to self-destruct
- Steppers have _zero_ torque, but tremendous "holding" power
- Conservation of angular momentum is a pain in the :donkey:
